PROBLEM STATEMENT:

MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a -bit hash value. Here are some common uses for MD5:
To store a one-way hash of a password.
To provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact.
MD5 is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, 1994); however, the security of MD5 has been severely compromised, most infamously by the Flame malware in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute essentially considers MD5 to be “cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use”.
Given an alphanumeric string, s, denoting a password, compute and print its MD5 encryption value.

Input Format-
A single alphanumeric string denoting s.

Constraints-
6 <= |s| <= 20
String s consists of English alphabetic letters (i.e.,[a-z A-Z] and/or decimal digits (i.e.,0 through 9) only.

Output Format-
Print the MD5 encryption value of s on a new line.

        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public static String computeMD5(String s) {
        try {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
            byte[] byteArray = s.getBytes("UTF-8");
            md.update(byteArray);
            byte[] md5Hash = md.digest();
            StringBuilder md5Hex = new StringBuilder();
            for (byte b : md5Hash) 
            {
                md5Hex.append(String.format("%02x", b));
            }
            return md5Hex.toString();
        } 
        catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | UnsupportedEncodingException e)
        {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
